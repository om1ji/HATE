# Currently, telegram bots have a 20 MB upload limitation
# for new files. If skip_if_over_20mb is False, 
# the bot will send the admins a message and you will
# have to upload the audio file manually to the temporary 
# channel. Then, the bot will parse that message and continue 
# as usual. If skip_if_over_20mb is True, the bot will 
# delete the folder and remove the link from the queue.
